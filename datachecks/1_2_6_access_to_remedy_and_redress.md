# Data Check - Thematic area: Access to remedy and redress

## Definitions

Access to effective remedy and redress refers to legal mechanisms that allow for human
rights violations to be thoroughly investigated and adequately resolved by rectifying the
harm that was caused and holding those responsible to account. Remedy, in this case,
refers to the removal of a harm; while redress refers to the compensation for, or
reparation of, that harm. Both components are required for effective enforcement of
human rights.
In the context of AI-related injuries, this requires persons who have suffered harm as a
result of the development or use of an AI system to be able to submit complaints, to
pursue legal actions in court, or to report issues to a competent authority and to have
those harms addressed with due diligence

## Identifications

This thematic area measures whether there are mechanisms that provide access to
remedy and redress where rights violations occur as a result of the use or development
of an AI system by a public or private entity. In particular, evidence must account for (1)
frameworks concerning access to remedy and redress from harm caused by AI systems,
(2) government actions to ensure access is provided to affected persons and
communities, and (3) non-state actors who are working to advance access to effective
remedy and redress mechanisms.
Frameworks may take the form of laws, regulations, policies (including by sector and/or
department)and/or guidelines. Government actions may include draft laws and/or
policies, the establishment of expert working groups, oversight bodies to monitor the
fairness of complaints mechanisms, and other efforts to strengthen access to remedy
and redress for those negatively impacted by AI. Non-governmental actors or non-state
actors (NSAs) may include non-governmental organisations (NGOs), but also
multinational corporations, private military organisations, media outlets, organised
ethnic groups, academic institutions, lobby groups, labour unions or social movements
working to advance access to fair mechanisms for remedy and redress in the context of
AI.

## Some Examples:

### Frameworks:

In September 2022, the European Commission adopted a proposal for “a targeted
harmonisation of national liability rules for AI” that would facilitate receipt of
compensation by “victims of AI-related damage” in a way that ensures their specific
“benefit from the same standards of protection” caused by harm from “AI products or
services” as from “any other circumstances.


### Government Actions

In April 2022, the European Parliament released a joint draft report in response to the
proposed EU Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA) which calls for the following amendments:
notification to individuals who are subjected to a high-risk AI decision-making system
(Amendment 145); provision for an individual’s right to “lodge a complaint against the
providers…of AI systems and receive compensation against any direct damage or loss”
inflicted concerning “health, safety, or fundamental rights”; inclusion of an individual’s
right to an “effective judicial remedy with regard to a legally binding decision” by a
national authority or the appropriate Commission or, in the case of improper handling of
the complaint itself, “with regard to the complaint” (Amendment 46).

### Non-state Actors

In the non-governmental sector, the European advocacy group and network collective
European Digital Rights (EDRi), in collaboration with 119 transnational civil society
organisations, launched a statement in November 2021 calling for amendments to the
AIA that would ‘foreground’ human rights and in the statement, call for “[m]eaningful
rights and redress for people impacted by AI systems,” including the right not to be
subjected to non-compliant systems alongside “the right to an explanation” around AIassisted decisions “and the right to a judicial remedy.” Accordingly, the association
published this proposed amendment in May 2022.
