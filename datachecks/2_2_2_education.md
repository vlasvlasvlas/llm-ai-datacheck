## Definitions

The right to education is foundational to human development and key to unlocking the potential of individuals, communities and societies at large. The right to education first found expression as a human right in Article 26 of the the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which states that ‘technical and professional education shall be made generally available’ and that ‘education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms’. The right to education has found further expression in various human rights instruments, including the Convention against Discrimination in Education (CADE); the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR); the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW); as well as the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).
In the context of responsible AI and the Global Index, the right to education refers to an individual's ability to access and participate in educational programmes that promote AI literacy, including basic concepts of AI, its impacts on society, and the technical skills necessary for its development. To ensure the right to education is fully realized in the context of AI, programmes should be provided at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Primary level education typically refers to grades 1 through 8 or students between ages 6 and 13; secondary level refers to grades 9 through 12 or students between ages 14 and 18; and tertiary level refers to any post high-school education that may grant undergraduate, graduate and/or vocational, bachelors, masters, and/or doctoral degrees and/or certificates.

AI literacy is defined as ‘a set of competencies that enable individuals to critically evaluate AI technologies; to communicate and collaborate effectively with AI; and to use AI as a tool online, at home, and in the workplace’, which extends beyond the mere use of AI applications. Specifically, UNESCO has expanded the definition of AI literacy to include both data literacy, or the ability to understand how AI collects, cleans, manipulates, and analyses data, and algorithm literacy, which is the ability to understand how AI algorithms find patterns and connections in the data. AI literacy should be on equal footing with and to reap the same benefits of AI technology as fellow citizens in the contexts of school, the workplace, and general society.

## Identifications

This thematic area examines the measures countries have in place to promote AI education at all three levels. In particular, evidence must account for (1) frameworks concerning AI systems, (2) government actions to implement these frameworks or address the topic, and (3) non-state actors working on the issue in the country.
Frameworks in the country, including both existing and proposed ones, may take the form of laws, regulations, policies (including by sector and/or department), bills and/or guidelines. Government actions may include the establishment of government bodies, including oversight bodies, responsible for providing policy recommendations on the issue and/or for enforcing regulation in addition to the implementation of programmes seeking to address the issue and/or to spread awareness or gather more data around it. Non-state actors (NSAs) may include non-governmental organisations (NGOs), but also multinational corporations, private military organisations, media outlets, organised ethnic groups, academic institutions, lobby groups, labour unions or social movements.
Measures may include: 
- Frameworks that promote AI in primary, secondary, technical, and vocational education and training institutions, higher education institutions, or informal learning opportunities
- Change of curriculum at primary/secondary/tertiary/university level to include AI-related courses
- Introduction of courses such as coding, robotics, programming e.t.c., at the primary and secondary levels and adult levels that are specific to AI
- Provision of bursaries and scholarships on STEM courses to students that are specific to AI
- Introduction of activities such as tech challenges, competitions, tech events, apprenticeships, and internships that encourage the uptake of STEM courses and other similar initiatives that are specific to AI
- Skills development training in administration and business processes that are being converted into or adapted to rely upon AI technologies
- Adult education courses or skills development in AI literacy programmes


## Some Examples:

### Frameworks examples:

To meet the demands of the 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR), India’s 2020 National Education Policy (NEP) calls for the integration of innovative technologies at all levels of education. This includes integrating AI into the national curricula and placing greater emphasis on mathematical skills and computational thinking and introducing coding-related activities in schools. The NEP urges universities to offer Ph.D. and Masters programmes in AI-related fields, such as Machine Learning, alongside other progressional areas and proposes that Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) offer “targeted training in low-expertise tasks for supporting the AI value chain such as data annotation, image classification, and speech transcription.” Moreover, the policy calls upon educational programmes to spread awareness around the ethical concerns and human rights impacts, including on data privacy and protection rights, of the development, deployment and use of AI systems.

### Government Actions examples:

India is one of eleven UNESCO member states that have developed, endorsed and implemented an AI curriculum called Atal Tinker Labs AI modules at the middle and high school levels. To implement the curriculum, Atal Innovation Mission is establishing Atal Tinkering Laboratories (ATLs) in schools across the country to “foster curiosity, creativity, and imagination in young minds” and to teach technical skills including “design mindset, computational thinking, adaptive learning, [and] physical computing.”

### Non-state Actors examples:

In the non-state sector, the organisation TeensinAI, launched at the UN AI for Good Global Summit, seeks to equip adolescents with the necessary skills to be empowered to use AI for innovative societal solutions through programmes such as tech-related courses and an ‘AI4Good Incubator.’ Meanwhile, the AI Education Project, devoted to promoting AI literacy for students, has developed a free innovative AI curriculum for educators.
