# Data Check - Thematic area: Cultural and Linguistic Diversity


## Definitions

Cultural diversity refers to the range of ideas, customs and social behaviors shared by different groups of people in time and place, often expressed through language. It is an integral ‘source of exchange, innovation and creativity’ which promotes the achievement of ‘a more satisfactory intellectual, emotional, moral and spiritual existence’ for all citizens. According to UNESCO, ‘[t]he defense of cultural diversity is an ethical imperative, inseparable from respect for human dignity’ and accordingly ‘implies a commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms,’ including those of minorities and/or indigenous persons.
The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) acknowledges cultural rights as fundamental human rights that are equal to civil and political rights as well as other social and economic rights. Further, Article 3 of the ICESCR calls on State Parties to ensure equal access ‘to the enjoyment of all economic, social and cultural rights’ set forth in the Covenant.
Cultural and linguistic diversity is an underpinning value of responsible AI and may be advanced through the active participation of all groups regardless of race, color, descent, gender, age, language, religion, political opinion, national origin, ethnic origin, social origin, economic or social condition of birth, or disability, or any other ground.

## Identifications

This thematic area examines the measures countries have in place to promote and protect cultural diversity in the design, development and use of AI. In particular, evidence must account for (1) frameworks concerning AI systems, (2) government actions to implement these frameworks or address the topic, and (3) non-state actors working on the issue in the country.
Frameworks in the country may take the form of laws, regulations, policies (including by sector and/or department), bills and/or guidelines. Government actions may include the establishment of government bodies such as oversight bodies responsible for providing policy recommendations on the issue and/or for enforcing regulation as well as the implementation of programmes seeking to address the issue and/or to spread awareness or gather more data around it. Non-state actors (NSAs) may include non-governmental organisations (NGOs), but also multinational corporations, private military organisations, media outlets, organised ethnic groups, academic institutions, lobby groups, labour unions or social movements.


## Some Examples:

### Frameworks examples:

In response to the risks associated with Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems - specifically the ‘loss of nuances in culture and language’ due to their reliance on algorithms to understand and interpret spoken words in the same way that humans do - Egypt’s 2019 National AI Strategy involves a plan to pilot at least five projects that promote the inclusion of culture and NLP, with one being rolled out to full scale.

### Government Actions examples:

Egypt has launched an Applied Innovation Center (AIC) with the aim of: (1) building national capacity in AI; and (2) developing a series of innovative AI projects that can be used to address a range of societal issues across a range of priority sectors, including NLP. Part of this involves the AIC collaborating with tech vendors to develop ‘leading-edge engines for machine translation, text to speech synthesis, and automatic speech recognition for colloquial Arabic’.

### Non-state Actors examples:

In the non-state sector, Google has been developing programs to promote regional language technologies in Africa. Efforts have included adding 24 new languages to Google Translate; researching the process of building speech recognition systems in African language; supporting local researchers through initiatives like Lacuna Fund; exploring innovative ways of building a text-to-speech (TTS) voice for low resource languages; and hosting community initiatives and workshops in the field at the company’s AI Research Centre in Ghana.
