# Data Check - Thematic area: Safety, Accuracy and Reliability

## Definitions

Safety can be generally defined as the condition of being protected from or unlikely to cause danger, risk, or injury. When applied to AI-related contexts, AI safety focuses specifically on technical solutions to ensure that AI systems and tools operate safely and reliably and do not introduce new harms or exacerbate existing risks.
Closely related to the concept of AI safety are the principles of accuracy and reliability. Accuracy can be defined as ‘the quality or state of being precise and correct’. If something is accurate, it is exact, meaning that it is not an approximation or estimation, and that its result is free from error or defect. In the context of AI, the principle of accuracy requires immediate steps to be taken to remove or rectify inaccurate data to ensure algorithmic outputs are both correct and precise.
Reliability can be defined as ‘the quality of being trustworthy or of performing consistently well’. In other words, reliability is the degree to which the result of a measurement, calculation or specification can be depended upon to be accurate. In the context of AI, reliability is the probability that an AI tool or system will perform its intended function correctly for a specific period of time and produce consistent and reproducible results.
Accordingly, accuracy and reliability can be treated as two separate, yet interrelated principles that contribute to AI safety and are foundational requirements for building trustworthy AI systems and tools.

## Identifications

This thematic area measures steps countries have taken to enhance AI safety by integrating principles of accuracy and reliability into the design, development, use and deployment of AI technologies. In particular, evidence must account for (1) frameworks that speak to AI safety and mention the principles and/or requirements for accuracy and reliability, (2) government actions to promote AI safety and implement measures to ensure the accuracy and reliability of AI systems and tools, and (3) non-state actors working to advance AI safety and motivate for standards and/or requirements for accuracy and reliability in building trustworthy AI systems.
Frameworks may take the form of adopted policies, white papers, or guidelines. Government actions may include draft policies and/or frameworks related to AI safety, the establishment of government bodies such as oversight bodies responsible for providing policy recommendations or for monitoring compliance with policies seeking to promote AI safety through accuracy, reliability standards. Non-state actors (NSAs) may include non-governmental organisations (NGOs), but also multinational corporations, private military organisations, media outlets, organised ethnic groups, academic institutions, lobby groups, labour unions or social movements working to advance the safety, accuracy and reliability of AI technologies.

## Some Examples:

### Frameworks:

In March 2021, the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), together with the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare Fire and Disaster Management Agency released the 2nd edition of the Guidelines on Assessment of AI Reliability in the Field of Plant Safety (Guidelines). The purpose of the Guidelines is to support plant owner companies in achieving accurate and reliable results to improve safety and productivity by providing a reliability assessment framework for vendors to use in conforming to industry standards for trustworthy AI.


### Government Actions

The National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) and the Japanese Standards Association (JSA) operate under the banner of METI and work on developing industry standards related to AI. In addition, these two institutes serve on the international body for the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 Subcommittee, which is working to develop global standards for AI trustworthiness, which includes requirements for accuracy and reliability of algorithmic modelling and outputs. In addition, Tokyo has hosted important conferences for the Subcommittee, such as SC42 meetings and the international Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) 2022 Conference to promote cooperation on AI-related principles, including accuracy and reliability.

### Non-state Actors

Fujitsu, a Japanese multinational information and communication technology (ICT) company, is one of the first Japanese companies to promote ethical AI through the establishment of its Fujitsu Group External Advisory Committee on AI Ethics. In 2022, the company established the “AI Ethics and Governance Office” which focuses on implementing measures to actively promote AI ethics through its Fujitsu Group AI Commitment, including a pledge to ‘leveraging its accumulated experience and knowledge on how to develop and constantly improve the reliability of AI”.
