# Data Check - Thematic area: Public Procurement

## Definitions

Public procurement is defined as ‘the process of purchasing goods, services, and works by governments as well as the enterprises which are paramountly owned by the state’. Generally speaking, public procurement processes are expected to be executed ‘efficiently’ and effectively in an effort to ‘safeguard the public interest’.

When it comes to AI, the focus on public procurement centers on ensuring that governments adhere to international procurement laws and principles of responsible AI as outlined in AI policy frameworks. These frameworks emphasize the importance of fair, transparent, inclusive, diverse, and non-discriminatory procurement of AI systems.


## Identifications

This thematic area measures steps countries have taken to manage the public procurement of AI systems. In particular, evidence must account for (1) frameworks concerning provisions or mechanisms for procurement of AI systems by the government in the delivery of public services, (2) government actions that demonstrate a clear commitment to procuring AI systems that align with human rights standards and responsible AI principles, and (3) non-state actors involved in promoting ethical principles of public procurement of AI systems.
Frameworks may take the form of laws, regulations, policies and/or guidelines. Government actions may include draft policies or guidelines, the establishment of expert working groups or oversight bodies, or any efforts to implement frameworks in relation to public procurement of AI. Non-state actors (NSAs) may include non-governmental organisations (NGOs), but also civil society organisations (CSOs), multinational corporations, private military organisations, media outlets, organised ethnic groups, academic institutions, lobby groups, labour unions or social movements promoting ethical principles of procurement of AI systems in the public sector.

## Some Examples:

### Frameworks:

The UK government has developed specific procurement guidelines for AI systems, which outline the key considerations for procurement officers when acquiring AI systems, including technical capabilities, data protection and privacy, and ethical considerations. These guidelines help to ensure that procurement officers are
equipped with the knowledge and skills they need to make informed decisions when acquiring AI systems.

### Government Actions

In addition, the UK government has taken several steps to ensure that procurement officers are equipped to handle the procurement of AI systems, including training programs and workshops. For example, it has established the Centre for Digital Built Britain (CDBB), which provides training and support for procurement officers on the use of AI and other digital technologies in the public sector. The CDBB provides training sessions and workshops on a range of topics, including AI procurement, data protection, and privacy.

### Non-state Actors

Finally, regarding non-state actors working on issues related to the government's acquisition of AI systems, in the UK Privacy International has been advocating for the use of procurement processes that ensure that AI systems are transparent, accountable, and free from bias and discrimination. The organization has worked with government agencies to promote procurement practices that prioritize privacy, such as requiring that AI systems be subjected to independent evaluations to ensure that they respect privacy rights.
