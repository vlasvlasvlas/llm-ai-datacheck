# Data Check - Thematic area: Health and Well-being


## Definitions

The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines health as ‘a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity’. When referring to a person or community, well-being can be described as the state of being comfortable, healthy and prosperous. Accordingly, the concept of health and well-being should be understood not only as the absence of physical ailments and disease, but also as including access to good living conditions, such as food, housing, and medical care. The right to health and well-being found its first found expression as a human right in the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) Constitution of 1946 which states that ‘the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being’. This right was later codified in 1948 under Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) which included health as part of the right to an adequate standard of living, and then again in 1966, when the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) recognised the right of everyone to enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Since then, many countries have taken measures to protect the right to health, by ratifying international treaties, enacting national legislation, and adopting policies, in addition to other measures, such as the adoption of strategies to leverage innovative technologies to promote people’s health and well-being.
Health and well-being are fundamental values of responsible AI, which should be advanced by ensuring the quality of life for both individuals and communities is protected and enhanced throughout all stages of the AI life cycle.

## Identifications

This thematic area examines steps that have been taken to promote and protect the right to health and well-being in the design, development and use of AI. In particular, evidence must account for (1) frameworks concerning the right to health and AI, (2) government actions to implement these frameworks or address the right to health in the context of AI, and (3) non-state actors working to advance the right to health and AI in the country.
Frameworks may take the form of laws, regulations, policies (including by sector and/or department), and/or guidelines. Government actions may include draft laws, policies or guidelines, the establishment of government oversight bodies or expert working groups to provide research or policy guidance on the issue, or the creation of government programmes to promote the right to health in the context of AI. Non-state actors (NSAs) may include non-governmental organisations (NGOs), but also multinational corporations, private military organisations, media outlets, organised ethnic groups, academic institutions, lobby groups, labour unions or social movements advancing the right to health in the context of AI.


## Some Examples:

### Frameworks examples:

In the United Kingdom, the National Health Service (NHS), as part of its Transformation Directorate, has developed the National Strategy for AI in Health and Social Care which seeks to ‘[Support] the equitable deployment of safe and effective AI-driven technologies at scale’ by ensuring AI-driven technologies are used ‘to help improve the patient experience, give the workforce a helping hand and help the system run more efficiently.’

### Government Actions examples:

To realise this transformation, the NHS has set up the NHS AI Lab, which aims to ‘[accelerate] the safe adoption of artificial intelligence in health and care’ by bringing together relevant actors, including government, health and care providers, academics and technology companies. Part of this process includes promoting AI regulation that seeks to ‘enable a world leading, safe and robust regulatory ecosystem for the development and deployment of AI systems’ and AI ethics that are integrated into the AI lifecycle in a patient-centred way to ensure ethical and effective adoption of AI in health and care.

### Non-state Actors examples:

InspiredMinds! is a global tech and science strategy group based in the UK which aims to promote responsible use of AI across various sectors, including healthcare, by facilitating connections between different actors within the AI ecosystem, including academics, healthcare practitioners, BigTech, investors, the science community and policymakers within government. The organisation hosts a series of events, including the Intelligent Health UK Series, which is a two-day conference that brings together actors in the global AI and healthcare community to engage in discussions on how to develop AI-driven solutions to advance access to health in an inclusive and equitable manner.
