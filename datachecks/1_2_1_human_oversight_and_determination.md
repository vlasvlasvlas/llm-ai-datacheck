# Data Check - Thematic area: Human Oversight and Determination

## Definitions:

Human oversight can be defined as 'the act of supervising something [a practice, or process] by humans to ensure it is being done correctly'. In the context of AI, human oversight requires systems to be designed in a way that allows for human supervision or control and provides clear channels for intervention or interference by humans to prevent or disrupt adverse effects in the use and deployment of AI tools. It is also worth noting that the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI
(Recommendation), expands the traditional definition of human oversight to include 'inclusive public oversight' in appropriate circumstances.
Human determination, which is often referred to as 'human agency', is defined as 'the capacity of an individual to act with free will', which is most clearly demonstrated through the choices people make. Human determination is closely related to the concept of personal autonomy, which not only concerns the ability to make choices voluntarily and independently, but also includes the freedom that is necessary to pursue and act in accordance with those choices. In the context of AI, human determination enables individuals to exercise judgment, evaluate complex ethical considerations, and make informed decisions that consider the broader societal impact, ensuring that AI is aligned with human values and responsible use

## Identifications:

This thematic area measures steps countries have taken to facilitate human oversight and determination of AI systems, and to ensure a certain degree of human control in the design and operation of AI systems. In particular, evidence must account for (1) frameworks concerning provisions or mechanisms for human oversight and
determination, (2) government actions regulating or promoting implementation of human oversight and determination in AI systems, and (3) non-governmental actors involved in promoting the principle of human oversight and establishing regulatory provisions to facilitate it.
Frameworks may take the form of laws, regulations, policies (including by sector and/or department) and/or guidelines. Government actions may include the
development of draft policies or laws calling for the integration of human oversight or human-in-the-loop in the roll-out of AI technologies, or the establishment of government task forces to provide recommendations on how to integrate these principles into the deployment of AI technologies. Non-governmental actors or nonstate actors (NSAs) may include non-governmental organisations (NGOs), but also multinational corporations, private military organisations, media outlets, organised ethnic groups, academic institutions, lobby groups, labour unions or social movements working to advance principles of human oversight and determination in the roll-out of AI systems across the country.

## Some Examples:

### Frameworks:

In October 2017, the European Union's Article 29 Data Protection Working Party, an independent body advising on data protection and privacy-related matters, adopted the Guidelines on Automated Individual Decision-Making and Profiling for the Purposes of Regulation 2016/679 (Guidelines), which provides a mechanism for 'human involvement' in profiling and automated decision-making processes. The Guidelines were developed to provide clarity on Article 22 of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which provides for the right 'not to be subjected to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects' on the individual. Specifically, the Guidelines describe human intervention as a key element of safeguarding the 'rights, freedoms and legitimate interests' of data subjects, and require the review of any automated decision 'to be carried out by someone [known as a Controller] who has the appropriate authority and capability to change the decision'. The Guidelines further note that Controllers 'should carry out frequent assessments on the data sets they process to check for any bias, and develop ways to address any prejudicial elements, including any over-reliance on corrections'.

### Government Actions:

Responsibility for monitoring implementation and compliance with the Guidelines was assigned to the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party (WP29), which released an updated version of the Guidelines in February 2018. During its first plenary meeting in May 2018, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) endorsed the Guidelines, and then took over responsibility for monitoring the implementation thereof in October 2018 following the dissolution of WP29. Since then, there has been no public record of the EDPB issuing any more guidance on related matters.

### Non-State Actors:

The Brussels Privacy Hub, a global academic research centre specialising in matters related to privacy, has been engaging with policymakers, data protection regulators, NGOs and the private sector since 2014 to produce 'cutting-edge research' on important issues relating to data protection and privacy law and policy. In January 2022, the BPH published a working paper entitled 'Humans in the GDPR and AIA Governance of Automated and Algorithmic Systems: Essential Prerequisites against Abdicating Responsibilities', which calls for conceiving human intervention in automated decision-making as a procedural right rather than an individual right to ensure the appropriate governance mechanisms are in place to achieve meaningful oversight in the rollout of AI systems and tools.
