# Data Check - Thematic area: Freedom of Expression and Access to Information

## Definitions

Freedom of expression is defined as the right of a person ‘to hold opinions without
interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas’ across different
forms of media. Although freedom of expression is often articulated as an individual
right, these protections also extend to groups of individuals who share the same
beliefs, thoughts, opinions and ideas. It is worth noting that the right to freedom of
expression is not an absolute right and can be limited under circumstances
provided for in law, including for respect of the rights and reputations of other
individuals and for the protection of national security, public order, or public health
and/or morals.
While the right to freedom of expression has been provided for under various legal
traditions, it was first articulated as a human right in 1948 when the UN General
Assembly adopted Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).
It was later enshrined in Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights ( ICCPR ), and further expanded upon in 2016 by the UN Human
Rights Committee’s (UNHRC) General Comment 34 , which recognised the right to
include protections for political discourse, political campaigning, discussions on
public affairs and human rights, journalistic freedom, cultural and artistic
expression, as well as religious discourse, which may be offensive to some people
but not void of protection. This right includes both verbal and non-verbal forms of
communications as well as all modes of expression, including audio-visual,
electronic and internet-based modes of communication.

General Comment 34 also acknowledges a general right of access to information
held by public bodies, which places an affirmative obligation on member states to
disclose government information that is in the public interest and ‘enact the
necessary procedures, whereby one may gain access to information, such as by
means of freedom of information legislation’.

Article 19 of the ICCPR articulates the right to freedom of expression in terms of
three core tenets : first, as the right to hold opinions without interference ( freedom
of opinion ); second, as the right to seek and receive information ( access to
information ); and three, as the right to impart information and ideas ( freedom of
expression ). The ICCPR further states that this right extends across borders and
includes those expressed orally, in writing, or in print, and in the form of art, or any
other media.
It is important to note that issues relating to freedom of expression and access to
information fall within the scope of this thematic area.

## Identifications

This thematic area measures steps countries have taken to protect the right to
freedom of expression and access to information in the design, development, use
and regulation of AI tools and systems, specifically in relation to social media. In
particular, evidence must account for (1) frameworks concerning freedom of
expression and access to information in the context of AI systems, (2) government
actions to implement these frameworks or address issues relating to freedom of
expression and access to information in the context of AI, and (3) non-state actors
working to promote the freedom of expression and access to information in the
design, development and deployment of AI systems.
Frameworks may take the form of laws, regulations, policies (including by sector
and/or department), and/or guidelines. Government actions may include draft laws,
policies or guidelines, as well as the establishment of government oversight bodies
to provide policy recommendations or oversee the implementation of programmes
seeking to address freedom of expression and access to information in the context
of AI systems. Non- state actors (NSAs) may include non-governmental
organisations (NGOs), but also multinational corporations, private military
organisations, media outlets, organised ethnic groups, academic institutions, lobby
groups, labour unions or social movements working to advance freedom of
expression and access to information in the context of AI systems.


## Some Examples:

### Frameworks:

In 2018, Germany’s Network Enforcement Act ( NetzDG ) came into effect which aims
to reduce incidents of fake news, hate speech and misinformation that are
communicated online. NetzDG requires social media platforms with more than 2
million users to remove ‘clearly illegal’ content (i.e. threats of violence and slander)
within 24 hours of a complaint being received, and all illegal content within 7 days
of it being posted, or be subject to a maximum fine of €50 million . Deleted content
must be stored for ten weeks for evidentiary purposes and internet platforms must
submit transparency reports every six months on the number of complaints
received and the measures that have been taken to address and resolve them.
N etzDG has been described as one of the strictest internet transparency laws in the
world, outlawing insult, malicious gossip, defamation, public incitement to crime,
incitement to hatred, disseminating portrayals of violence and threatening the
commission of a felony.

### Government Actions

In 2019, Germany’s Federal Office of Justice imposed a €2 million fine on Facebook
for under-reporting complaints about illegal content on its social media platform in
breach of NetzGD. According to German authorities, Facebook provided
“incomplete” information in mandatory transparency reports about illegal content,
including hate speech, by only reporting the complaints that had violated NetzGD.
Selective reporting by Facebook resulted in the company citing a total of 1,704
complaints between 1 January and 30 June 2018, compared to the numbers that
YouTube (215,000) and Twitter (265,000) reported for the full year, presenting a
skewed picture of the total number of violations .

### Non-state Actors

HateAid is a non-profit organisation based in Germany that promotes human rights
in the digital space, including social media platforms that rely on AI-driven
processes, and takes efforts to address digital violence and its impacts at both
social and political levels. It does this by providing direct counseling and legal
support to people who have been subjected to digital violence, including hate
speech, and by raising awareness of the problems posed by weak regulation of AI,
namely those embedded in the programming of social media platforms. In July
2022, it published a blog highlighting weaknesses in the transparency reports
submitted by large tech companies under Germany’s NetzGD, and put together a
series of recommendations for legislators to strengthen oversight and enhance
protections for online users.
