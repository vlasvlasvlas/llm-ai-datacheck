# Data Check - Thematic area: Algorithmic Decision-Making

## Definitions

Algorithmic decision-making can be defined as ‘the use of algorithms or mathematical models to make decisions or predictions’. These algorithms are designed to analyse large amounts of data, identify patterns and trends, and use this information to make decisions. In AI, algorithmic decision-making entails the use of data-driven models to make automatic decisions, without the intervention of humans. They can be used in a wide range of applications, from natural language processing, and image recognition to predictive maintenance and fraud detection.

## Identifications

This thematic area measures steps countries have taken to respond to the risks and opportunities posed by algorithmic decision-making technologies. In particular, evidence must account for (1) frameworks relating specifically to algorithmic decision-making, (2) government actions to develop and/or implement measures to confront the risks posed specifically by algorithmic decision-making technologies and (3) non-state actors working specifically to advance, enable or enforce responsible use of algorithmic decision-making technologies. Information that is not specific to algorithmic decision-making will not be considered as evidence for the questions posed under this thematic area.
Frameworks may take the form of laws, policies, regulations, or guidelines. Government actions may include draft laws or policies that are currently being reviewed by other branches of government, the establishment of expert working groups or oversight bodies to provide recommendations on algorithmic decision making or the implementation of policies related to their responsible and ethical use.

Non-state actors (NSAs) may include non-governmental organisations (NGOs), but also multinational corporations, private military organisations, media outlets, organised ethnic groups, academic institutions, lobby groups, labour unions or social movements seeking to advance the responsible and ethical use of algorithmic decision-making processes.

## Some Examples:

### Frameworks:

The French Data Protection Authority (CNIL) is a government agency that was created by the French Data Protection Act in January 6, 1978. CNIL acts as an independent administrative authority which is responsible for maintaining the protection of personal data and privacy rights in France. CNIL has developed guidelines to provide guidance and promote accountability in algorithmic decision-making processes. An example of guidelines that CNIL has published is Guidelines on Automated Individual Decision-Making and Profiling (2017). This was published to assist organizations in complying with the requirements of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regarding automated decision-making and profiling. The items that are mentioned in this guideline present an explanation on key concepts, transparency, obligations and the right to explanation for individuals.

### Government Actions

The Council of Europe engaged in a collaboration with the French Defender of Rights to execute a course titled AI and Discriminations. The last course was conducted from October to December 2022. The course considered recent developments in the field of AI governance, which included regulation, risks and harms, standards and practices that are associated with the use and implementation of AI systems. This course was attended by CNIL, civil society, stakeholders and government officials in order to gain greater insight into the discrimination and bias affiliated with AI. The course outlined the challenges algorithmic decision-making may pose on human rights. It also discussed new regulations that can be developed and implemented in this particular area. The aim of the course was to equip stakeholders with the skills required to better identify and respond to harms caused by AI systems such as algorithmic decision-making.

### Non-state Actors

La Quadrature du Net is a digital rights advocacy group that focuses on defending civil liberties in the digital age. They engage in policy debates, raise awareness about algorithmic decision-making, and advocate for transparency, accountability, and rights. In addition, the Internet Society France works on a range of issues, including algorithmic decision-making and promoting open standards, ethical use of AI, and the responsible development of algorithms through research, advocacy, and stakeholder engagement.
