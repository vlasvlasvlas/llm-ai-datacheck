# Data Check - Thematic area: International Cooperation


## Definitions

International cooperation can be defined as ‘a collaborative relationship between [countries] to work toward shared objectives through a mutually agreed division of labor’. At a national level, this requires engaging government leadership, national stakeholders, and external partners (e.g. partnering countries, international development agencies, etc.) to collaborate when developing, implementing, and monitoring actions that aim to achieve similar objectives. In this regard, international cooperation is not limited to the state or national level, but can include cross-border cooperation between different sectors including intergovernmental organisations, non-governmental organisations, independent research institutions, professional associations, academic universities, and transnational corporations, to name a few. In the context of AI, international cooperation refers to joint efforts between countries to align policy instruments in relation to AI to ensure: (1) global adherence to responsible AI principles; (2) inclusive and equitable access to the benefits and opportunities offered by AI; (3) trust and accountability mechanisms between countries; and (4) advancement of scientific research and technical knowledge

## Identifications

This thematic area measures steps countries have taken to strengthen and facilitate international cooperation on AI. In particular, evidence must account for: (1) frameworks relating to international cooperation on: AI regulatory policy, international standards for AI, and selection of international AI use cases (2) government actions to develop, support and/or strengthen international cooperation with respect to AI, including: the promotion of AI research and development; AI regulation, standards and compliance requirements; and (3) non-state actors working to promote international cooperation in adherence to responsible AI principles and practices.
Frameworks may take the form of adopted laws, policies, regulations or guidelines specifically in relation to AI. Government actions may include the development of draft laws, policies or guidelines, or the formation of government entities like oversight bodies tasked with providing policy recommendations on the matter and/or enforcing regulations. Additionally, these actions can involve the execution of policies aimed at facilitating greater levels of international cooperation and/or promoting awareness around its value in the context of AI.Non-state actors (NSAs) may include non-governmental organisations (NGOs), but also multinational corporations, private military organisations, media outlets, organised ethnic groups, academic institutions, lobby groups, labour unions or social movements promoting increased levels of international cooperation to advance responsible AI.

## Some Examples:

### Frameworks examples:

Serbia’s National AI Strategy emphasizes the importance of international cooperation in knowledge transfer to support the acceleration of various scientific fields. The strategy highlights the need for increased international cooperation to facilitate the transfer of knowledge and experience, along with the involvement of international experts who can contribute their expertise and support research in Serbian scientific organizations. In addition, the strategy recognizes the significance of AI conferences and advocates for supporting the participation of Serbian researchers in major international conferences on artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the strategy recognizes the importance of providing researchers with access to essential published materials and other necessary services to support their research endeavors.

### Government Actions examples:

In September 2020, the United States’ Department of Defense’s Joint AI Centre hosted an inaugural meeting for the multilateral AI Partnership for Defense with representatives from various countries, including: Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Japan, Norway, South Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The outcome of the meeting was the formal establishment of the AI Partnership for Defense which is a multinational forum that aims to ‘promote the responsible use of AI, advance shared interests and best practices on AI ethics implementation, establish frameworks to facilitate cooperation, and coordinate strategic messaging on AI policy’ amongst participating countries.

### Non-state Actors examples:

In 2019, The Brookings Institution, a non profit organisation based in the United States, and the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS), an independent think-tank on European policies, established the Forum for Cooperation on AI (FCAI) in an effort to facilitate deeper discussions on issues emerging from global trends in AI and to enhance greater levels of international cooperation on AI development and responsible AI policymaking. In October 2021, the Brookings Institute released a progress report entitled ‘Strengthening International Cooperation on AI’ which identifies concrete steps that would benefit international cooperation, as well as subjects that will be explored by FCAI in greater depth over the coming years, including government use of AI and developing common regulatory approaches and frameworks.
