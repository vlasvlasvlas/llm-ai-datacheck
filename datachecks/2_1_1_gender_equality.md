# Data Check - Thematic area: Gender Equality

## Definitions

Gender equality is defined as the granting of “equal rights, responsibilities and opportunities'' to people of all gender identities, which extends beyond the traditional binary concept of equality between women and men, and girls and boys. Accordingly, gender does not only refer to the biological sex assigned to a person at birth, but also incorporates how a person identifies as being male, female, or somewhere outside the binary. In this regard, the right to gender equality not only includes protections for women and girls, but also for persons who identify as non-binary (including gender queer, gender fluid), transgender, and/or intersex, as well as sexual minorities (homosexuals, bisexuals, asexuals, etc.).
Traditionally, the right to gender equality was framed within the right to be free from discrimination on the basis of ‘sex’, which has been invoked to provide women and girls with equal protection under the law and access to the same economic, social and political opportunities as men as boys. This is the language reflected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While these frameworks are important tools for protecting the rights of women and girls, the use of binary language poses the risk of ignoring the rights of gender non-conforming persons and sexual minorities altogether.

## Identifications

This thematic area examines the measures countries have in place to promote and protect gender equality in the design, development and use of AI tools and systems. National frameworks may take the form of laws, regulations, policies (including by sector and/or department) and/or guidelines. Evidence collected must account for gender equality frameworks for AI systems, for government actions to implement these frameworks or to address the issue of gender equality in the absence of a specific framework, and for non-state actors working on the issue in the country.
Frameworks may take the form of adopted policies, laws, regulations, white papers, or guidelines. Government actions may include draft policies, the establishment of government bodies or task teams to conduct research relating to the implications of AI on gender equality. Non-State Actors (NSAs) may include non-governmental organisations (NGOs), but also multinational corporations, private military organisations, media outlets, organised ethnic groups, academic institutions, lobby groups, labour unions or social movements, that work to advance issues related to gender equality in AI.


## Some Examples:

### Frameworks:

In the USA, the National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality recognizes the exclusion of “the voices and needs of women and girls from the development and governance of” tools like AI and in response, calls for the promotion of “equity, access, and nondiscrimination in STEM fields,” including AI.

### Government Actions

In Canada, the Gender-Based Analysis Plus (GBA-Plus) is a tool that is used to identify and assess how different genders may be affected by policies, programs and initiatives. A review of the Directive on Automated Decision-Making proposed that GBA-Plus be completed when developing or modifying an automated system (OpenGov Partnership). Similarly, in 2021, the state-sponsored UK Research and Innovation established guidelines for conducting an equality impact assessment (EIA), which public authorities are recommended to conduct to comply with Section 149 of the 2010 Equality Act expanding the range of “protected characteristics”. (Commons Library).

### Non-state Actors

In Uganda, Pollicy, a non-profit organisation works to integrate AI into the larger feminist movement by promoting suitable data governance practices and advocating for responsible policies by engaging with women’s groups and gender minorities.
