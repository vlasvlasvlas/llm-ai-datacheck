# Data Check - Thematic area: Labour Protection and Right to Work


## Definitions

Labor protections are broadly defined as the ‘protection of employment conditions, working conditions, and labor welfare as well as occupational safety, health and environmental conditions provided for an employee’. Labor protections often include preventative measures that safeguard the legal, economic, social, technical aspects of a safe and healthy working environment, such as mitigating the risk of accidents and/or diseases that can arise from poor working conditions. Statutory labor protections may guarantee minimum wages; annual, sick and parental leave; due process for disciplinary actions and dismissal; health and safety standards; and the right to collective bargaining.
Labor protections were first expressed as human rights in terms of Article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which states that every worker is entitled to just and favorable conditions of work, to equal pay for equal work, to just remuneration (which provides dignity and social protection), and to form and join trade unions. These rights are further elaborated in international labor standards, including the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions that are ratified by member states, which also provides the right to a safe and healthy working environment (Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work), as well as to fair processes surrounding termination of employment (Termination of Employment Convention 158, 1982).
Platform work refers to “a form of employment that uses an online [digital labor] platform to enable organisations or individuals to access other organisations or individuals to solve problems or to provide services in exchange for payment,” examples being TaskRabbit or Uber. Platform work utilises AI algorithms or other AI-facilitated tools to match workers with customers; to monitor and manage performances; and to evaluate worker performance.
The right to work is recognised as a fundamental right under Article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) which provides that ‘[e]veryone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment.’ The right to work is further expanded upon in Article 6 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR); Article 11 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW); Article 15 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (EU Charter); Article 15 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights (African Charter); and Article 6 of the Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights in the Area of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (the San Salvador Protocol).

## Identifications

This thematic area examines the steps countries have taken to protect workers’ rights with specific regard to the risks AI poses to them, adapting to the increasing use of AI in the labour force. In particular, evidence must account for (1) frameworks concerning AI systems, (2) government actions to implement these frameworks or address the topic, and (3) non-state actors working on the issue in the country.
Frameworks may take the form of laws, regulations, policies (including by sector and/or department), and/or guidelines. Government actions may include draft laws, policies or guidelines, the establishment of government bodies to provide policy recommendations or to enforce laws and/or regulations on labour protections in the context of AI. . Non-state actors (NSAs) may include non-governmental organisations (NGOs), but also multinational corporations, private military organisations, media outlets, organised ethnic groups, academic institutions, lobby groups, labor unions or social movements in relation to strengthening labour protections in the context of AI.

Labor protection frameworks with respect to AI could include:
- The extension of minimum labor protections to all workers, including those who lack an employment contract but subject to algorithmic management systems
- Transparency in the management process, including obligations to explain AI systems that interact with and affect workers, and workers’ right to access the digital workplace for unions/organisations and representatives
- Requirements for human decision-making where decisions affect access to work and workers’ rights (including in hiring, termination, remuneration, disciplinary action, and performance measurement)
- Remedy and redress for workers where the use of AI has violated their rights
- Protection against job-loss due to automation


## Some Examples:

### Frameworks examples:

Article 13 the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires those collecting personal data to inform subjects of ‘the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling’ as well as the rationale, i.e. ‘meaningful information about the logic involved’ and ‘the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing’ for the individual. The Spanish Government recently approved the Rider Law, which surpasses the GDPR by ‘requir[ing] employers using algorithmic decision-making to disclose key attributes of the algorithm to employee representatives’ including the ‘algorithm’s parameters and general logic used to make decisions’. Portugal’s Data Protection Authority (CNPD) has published “explicit guidelines” specifically banning the use of AI-driven surveillance tools for the remote monitoring of employees with specific exceptions, while the Norwegian Data Protection Authority has published clear best practices for employers with regard to digital monitoring technologies.

### Government Actions examples:

The European Parliament has established a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence in a Digital Age (AIDA) ‘with a mandate to analyse the future impact of AI on the EU economy, including on skills and employment’. In May 2022, AIDA’s final Report condemned the increased prevalence of ‘AI-fuelled surveillance in the workplace’ and called for increased levels of transparency around the use of AI and its impact on working conditions. Meanwhile, in its 2021 Proposal, the European Commission specifically calls for the high-risk classification of AI systems used for functions across labor management sectors as well as for the specific inclusion of individuals in platform work in the definition of ‘work-related contractual relationships’.

### Non-state Actors examples:

In the non-state sector, the ILO is operating an EU-funded project examining the impact of AI-driven algorithmic management practices within the increasingly ‘platformised’ logistics and healthcare sectors on ‘work organisation, efficiency and working conditions in European (France, Italy) and non-European (India, South Africa) countries. The project seeks to analyse whether these practices positively impact workers and which social and human rights standards are upheld as well as determine the policies needed to address the challenges and risks incurred by the use of AI.
