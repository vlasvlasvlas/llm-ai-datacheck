# Data Check - Thematic area: Impact Assessments

## Definitions:

An impact assessment can be defined as 'a structured process for considering the implications, for people and their environment, of proposed actions while there is still an opportunity to modify [or abandon] the proposed actions' if the impact they pose contains a potential or actual threat of harm . Harm , in this context, can be defined as 'a wrongful setback or injury' and, in legal terms , is often expressed as a 'violation of an interest'. It is also important to note that harms can occur at the individual, communal, and societal levels. In the context of AI, impact assessments can be used as a tool for both predicting the anticipated, and assessing the actual, consequences of an AI system in terms of benefits and harms. When assessing anticipated risks, impact assessments require users of AI technologies to consider the type and scope of impact before and after deployment. Accordingly, it is useful to think about impact assessments in terms of two types: ex-ante impact assessmen t and ex-post impact assessments.

- Ex-ante impact assessment : involves an analysis of the potential benefits and harms of an AI system in a particular context and for a specific purpose prior to making the decision to deploy.

- Ex-post impact assessment: involves an analysis of the actual benefits and harms imposed by an AI system after making the decision to deploy.

## Identifications:

This thematic area measures steps countries have taken to integrate impact assessments, including both ex-ante and ex-post impact assessments, into the design, development, use and deployment of AI technologies. In particular, evidence must account for (1) frameworks relating to impact assessments, (2) government actions to develop and/or implement impact assessments, and (3) non-state actors working to advance use of both ex-ante and ex-post impact assessments in the context of AI. Frameworks may take the form of adopted policies, white papers, or guidelines that call for the use of impact assessments for AI. Government actions may include the development of draft policies mandating the use of impact assessments in AI or the establishment of government oversight bodies, to ensure that impact assessments are being used in the roll-out of AI technologies, specifically those classified as high-risk. Non-state actors (NSAs) may include non-governmental organisations (NGOs), but also multinational corporations, private military organisations, media outlets, organised ethnic groups, academic institutions, lobby groups, labour unions or social movements working to advance use of impact assessments in AI.

## Some Examples:

### Frameworks:

In 2020, South Korea became the first country to develop national-level legislation that calls for social impact assessments in the use of AI systems. Article 56 of the Framework Act on Intelligent Informatization (2020) provides a discretionary mechanism for state and local governments to 'survey and assess' the impact of AI driven technologies in terms of the following components: (1) safety and reliability of intelligent information services; (2) impacts on information culture, such as closing the digital divide, protection of privacy and ethics for the intelligent information society; (3) impacts on the society and the economy, such as employment, labour , fair trade, industrial structure, rights and interests of users, etc.; (4) impacts information protection; and (5) other impacts of intelligent information services, etc. on the society, economy, culture and citizens daily lives. While the national law is a first-of-its-kind , it is only applicable to the public sector and the impact assessments are voluntary.

### Government Actions:

Under the Framework on Intelligent Informatization Act (2020), the Ministry of Science and ICT in South Korea has the discretion to publish the results of the social impact assessments and to make recommendations to national agencies, public entities and private sector businesses on how to improve the safety and reliability of AI systems and tools. Although to-date, the Ministry of Science and ICT has not yet published the results of social impact assessments, it has participated in various initiatives to promote responsible use of AI, such as co-hosting a Webinar on AI for Good together with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) on leveraging the benefits of AI.

### Non-State Actors:

MINBYUN â€“ Lawyers for a Democratic Society is a non-governmental organisation based in Seoul that is composed of more than 1100 lawyers dedicated to increasing public awareness and collaborating in joint activities to protect basic human rights and attain social justice. In 2022, MINBYUN, together with a group of civil society organisations based in South Korea, made a submission to the UN High.

Commissioner for Human Rights on its report entitled The right to privacy in the digital age (2022) . The report laid out its concerns with the use of AI in surveillance systems and limitations of the Framework on Intelligent Informatization Act (2020), specifically in relation to whether the Ministry of Science and ICT is sufficiently competent and independent to conduct the social impact assessments.
