# Data Check - Thematic area: Public Participation and Awareness

## Definitions

Public participation, which may also be referred to as ‘public engagement’, is defined as the process of engaging ordinary people in the decision-making processes that affect their lives and give full consideration to their input before making decisions. These processes require open, honest, and ongoing communication between decision-makers and stakeholders, including those who are interested in, and/or affected by, the decisions that will be made, even when those stakeholders have different concerns and/or interests.
In addition to being a defining principle of democratic societies, public participation is also expressed as a fundamental human right in various legal instruments. Article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) states that every person has the right to participate in the affairs of the country, either directly or by an elected representative. The right to public participation finds further expression as a human right in Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which states that all citizens have the right to have equal access to public services in the country. Public awareness is defined as the process of informing the general public and increasing levels of consciousness about the potential benefits and risks associated with a particular action or decision. This process requires providing people with accurate, up-to-date, information that is accessible to a wide range of audiences using different modes of communication that are appropriate to different groups.

## Identifications

This thematic area examines steps countries have taken to promote public participation in the design, development and use of AI technologies as well as increase public awareness about its use and impacts in various facets of life. In particular, evidence must account for (1) frameworks concerning AI systems, (2) government actions to implement these frameworks or promote public participation and awareness outside of a formal framework, and (3) non-state actors supporting the promotion of public participation and awareness in the use and development of AI in the country.
Frameworks may take the form of laws, regulations, policies (including by sector and/or department), and/or guidelines. Government actions may include draft policies or laws, the establishment of oversight bodies,responsible for providing policy recommendations, the establishment of formal platforms for public engagement on issues relating to AI and their integration in the public services, or the rollout of public awareness campaigns on AI. Non--state actors (NSAs) may include non-governmental organisations (NGOs), but also multinational corporations, universities, civil society groups, media outlets, organised ethnic groups, academic institutions, lobby groups, labor unions or social movements working to increase public participation and awareness on AI throughout the country.


## Some Examples:

### Frameworks:

Finland’s 2019 Artificial Intelligence Programme (AIP) outlines a vision for promoting engagement and cooperation between various stakeholders including ‘donors, the public sector, companies, RDI (research, development and innovation)’, as well as the community at large in the design, development and governance of AI. The framework defines people’s relationship to AI not as ‘passive consumers’ but rather as ‘active participants’ in its development and application. Accordingly, Finland’s AIP calls for public involvement in decisions about the disclosure of their information as well as decisions that will determine the types of services provided using AI tools.

### Government Actions

A central focus of Finland’s National AI Strategy is on ‘raising the awareness of its citizens through public online courses, such as the Elements of AI’ by offering ‘top-level AI education at its universities’ that are open to the general public. This is done not only to increase knowledge of AI amongst the general public, but to ensure that discussions around AI could become more integrated into mainstream debate as part of Finland’s quest to become ‘leader in AI’.

### Non-state Actors

Finland’s Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) has established the Forum for Ethical AI in collaboration with DeepMind to promote ‘debate and conversation’ with ordinary citizens. In 2018, the Forum engaged ‘ordinary, non-technically-minded people’ in a citizens’ jury to discuss AI and its current uses in critical sectors like healthcare and justice.
