# Data Check - Thematic area: Environmental Protection and Sustainability


## Definitions

Environmental sustainability refers to the ability to maintain an ecological balance in the planet’s natural environment and conserve natural resources to support the wellbeing of current and future generations. Discussions around AI have largely neglected the environmental impact of its production, which is why this is such a critical area to assess.
Sustainable AI is an emerging concept that is defined as ‘a movement which aims to inspire change throughout the AI lifecycle (i.e. idea generation, training, returning, implementation, governance) towards greater ecological integrity and social justice’. In this regard, the focus of Sustainable AI extends beyond the application of AI systems and promotes the development of AI in a way that respects: (1) sustainable use of environmental resources for current and future generations; (2) economic models that support societies; and (3) fundamental societal values.
Accordingly, this thematic area is grounded in the broader conceptual framework of Sustainable AI, which is composed of two separate, but interrelated parts: (1) AI for sustainability; and (2) sustainability of AI. AI for sustainability refers to the application of AI systems for the purpose of achieving sustainability in some manner, such as for environmental conservation or for the achievement of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Sustainability of AI refers to sustainability of developing and using AI models, such as extent of carbon footprints, impact of computational power for training algorithms, rising temperatures of cloud storage.

## Identifications

This thematic area examines steps countries have taken to (1) promote sustainable AI , (2) mitigate its adverse environmental effects in the long-term effort towards sustainable AI, and (3) promote the use of AI in facilitating the ecological and social sustainability of other industries. In particular, evidence must account for (1) frameworks concerning the environmental impact and sustainability of AI systems, (2) government actions to implement these frameworks or to address the topic of environmental protection and sustainability, and (3) non-state actors working to advance these protections across the country.
Frameworks may take the form of laws, regulations, policies (including by sector and/or department), and/or guidelines. Government actions may include draft laws or policies, the establishment of government bodies, including oversight bodies, responsible for providing policy recommendations on the issue and/or for enforcing regulation in addition to the implementation of programmes seeking to address the issue and/or to spread awareness or gather more data around it. Non-state actors (NSAs) may include non-governmental organisations (NGOs), but also multinational corporations, private military organisations, media outlets, organised ethnic groups, academic institutions, lobby groups, labour unions or social movements working to advance environmental protections and sustainability across the country.


## Some Examples:

### Frameworks examples:

France’s National AI Strategy includes provisions that address both the environmental impact of AI in relation to the sustainability of AI as well as the use of AI to promote environmental sustainability and to address climate change in particular. This strategic area calls for the design and development of more environmentally-friendly AI – including the development of more ecological AI infrastructure (e.g. the cloud industry) – and for AI applications to reduce the impact of human-inflicted environmental harm.

### Government Actions examples:

The National AI Research Program (NAIRP) and the National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology (INRIA) are playing a leading role in the implementation of France’s National AI Strategy, specifically in research and innovation. In March 2021, INRIA researchers completed project Perf-AI, in collaboration with an aeronautics start-up, to develop energy-optimised digital aircraft models using AI-driven data. In addition, the Ministry of Economy and Finance, together with eight leading French industrial corporations, signed a joint Manifesto outlining a common strategic vision for AI which included agreements to conduct joint reviews, share findings with policymakers, develop a coordinated plan of action, and promote like-minded public and private stakeholder participation in the ongoing development of environmentally sustainable AI.

### Non-state Actors examples:

In the non-state sector, Schneider Electric, a multinational company specialising in energy management and digital automation, is using innovative technologies to enhance the environmental sustainability of one of its flagship buildings in Grenoble, France. The company is leveraging the power of AI systems to stabilise temperatures, optimize its solar energy supply, and improve the efficiency of how the facility is managed. Their flagship building in France, which is referred to as IntenCity, is known as one of the ‘greenest’ in Europe.
