# Data Check - Thematic area: Public Sector Skills Development


## Definitions

Skills development can be defined as the ‘acquisition of work-related skills and competencies through employment education and training’. Although skills development can be generally understood as ‘basic education, initial training and lifelong learning’, in the context of the workforce, it refers to the development of competencies that are necessary to perform ‘a trade or occupation in the labor market’.
In the context of AI, skills development refers to the technical knowledge, capabilities and proficiencies that are required to ‘successfully integrate AI into functions’ across various industries, in both the public and private sectors. This should not be interpreted to include educational curriculum provided at the tertiary level, which will be covered under the Education Thematic Area.
Skills development programmes could be in the form of:
- Capacity building programmes for civil servants or government personnel working in units/departments deploying AI systems
- Training programmes for judges and other members of the judiciary on AI-related laws and regulations
- Change of competency requirements to include AI-related skills
- Introduction of courses such as coding, robotics, programming, etc. for civil servants specifically
- Provision of bursaries and scholarships on AI courses to civil servants outside of the tertiary education environment
- Introduction of activities such as tech challenges, competition, tech events, apprenticeship, internships that encourage the uptake of courses, in relation to AI, across the civil service.

## Identifications

This thematic area measures steps countries have taken to support skills development in relation to responsible AI within the civil service and judiciary. In particular, evidence must account for: (1) frameworks relating to skills development programmes for the civil service and judiciary, specifically in the responsible use of AI systems and tools and the governance thereof; (2) government actions to develop, implement and/or support skills development programmes for responsible AI in priority sectors, as well as by the judiciary, including through the development of jurisprudence to ensure responsible AI principles are enforceable in practice; and (3) non-state actors working to promote skills development programmes for responsible AI across the civil service and judiciary. As mentioned before, this is separate from AI-related curriculum at the tertiary level, which is not targeted specifically at building the competencies of civil servants. That material should be captured under the Education Thematic area.

Frameworks may take the form of adopted policies, strategies, white papers, or guidelines calling for the rollout of AI literacy programmes across the civil service to ensure a basic level of competency. Government actions may include the development of draft policies, strategies or guidelines that aim to improve the capacity of civil servants in AI technologies and to understand its implications in law. Government actions can also involve setting up governmental bodies, such as oversight entities, which are tasked with offering policy recommendations on specific issues and/or enforcing regulations, or implement policies that aim to build AI literacy. . Non-state actors (NSAs) may include non-governmental organisations (NGOs), but also multinational corporations, private military organisations, media outlets, organised ethnic groups, academic institutions, lobby groups, labour unions or social movements to advocate for the importance of building competencies related to AI across the civil service.

## Some Examples:

### Frameworks examples:

The UK Science and Technology Framework identifies five critical technologies that are critical for positioning the United Kingdom to become ‘the most innovative economy in the world’, of which AI is one. To create an environment for these technologies to flourish in the UK, the Ministry of Science and Technology has committed to addressing skills gaps and providing opportunities for civil servants to enhance their AI-related skills through training and upskilling programs.

### Government Actions examples:

In March 2022, the UK government released its Digital, Data and Technology (DDAT) training skills programme which aims to upskills more than 5,500 senior civil servants in data and artificial intelligence (AI). The programme was developed ‘in response to a global government problem’ of senior leaders lacking the capability ‘to optimise the opportunities of fast-moving, world-changing technology that has implications for global security and economic dominance and for the services delivered to citizens’. The Central Digital and Data Office is responsible for leading the skills development programme and has been working to develop a DDat Essential standards for upskilling senior civil servants, and released five core competencies it aims to build: (1) data essentials; (2) technology essentials; (3) digital essentials; (4) users first; and (5) innovation mindset. The Office has established a working group and issued a public call for people to get involved in the shaping of the programme.

### Non-state Actors examples:

The Global Government Forum is an independent organization based in the UK which provides publications, events and research that helps senior civil servants around the world to meet global challenges by building their expertise, knowledge and connections. In 2022, it released a report which found that only 5% of civil servants had received training in AI, and that ‘while 78% of respondents would like more digital skills training, many do not feel confident in their own or in their department’s digital skills’.
