# Data Check - Thematic area: Competitions Authorities


## Definitions

A competitions authority, commonly referred to as a ‘competitions regulator’ is responsible for overseeing the fair functioning of markets in a given country. While their form may vary across countries, most competition authorities are independent ‘stand-alone’ bodies and/or agencies that have the legal authority and mandate to regulate and enforce competitions law (e.g. antitrust law), and, in some instances, consumer protection laws. Competition authorities often have the power to investigate cases, issue rulings, and enforce penalties. In addition, competition authorities tend to be responsible for leading the development of competitions policy, which seeks to maintain market competition by regulating anti-competitive conduct by companies.
Some examples of competitions authorities include the Competitions and Market Authority (United Kingdom), the Federal Trade Commission (United States), the Authority for Consumers and Markets (the Netherlands), the Competition Regulatory Authority (Angola), the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (Brazil), and the Competition Commission (India). In addition, some competitions authorities operate at a regional level to not only facilitate competitive business practices across a particular region, but also to support competitive markets in countries where no competitions authorities exist. Examples include the East African Community Competitions Authority and the European Union’s European Competition Network.

## Identifications

This thematic area measures steps countries have taken to support the involvement of competitions authorities in the development, use and deployment of AI technologies to promote a free market. In particular, evidence must account for (1) frameworks relating to competition laws and relevant authorities, specifically on promoting competitive market practices in the development and deployment of AI systems and tools, (2) government actions to develop and/or implement competitions law and consumer protection legislation, including recent decisions on cases of market authorities involving AI, investigations into AI service providers and products, issuing of fines or penalties, or the imposition of sanctions, and (3) non-state actors working to advance competitions law and fair market practices in the context of AI, by providing any comments/guidelines on how to apply competition law to AI and protect consumer rights.
Frameworks may take the form of adopted laws, policies, regulations, white papers, or guidelines. Government actions may include the development of draft laws or policies, the establishment of government oversight bodies to provide policy recommendations or the enforcement of competitions regulations in respect of AI.Non-state actors (NSAs) may include non-governmental organisations (NGOs), but also multinational corporations, private military organisations, media outlets, organised ethnic groups, academic institutions, lobby groups, labour unions or social movements working to advance competitions law and fair market practices in the context of AI.


## Some Examples:

### Frameworks examples:

In South Africa the Competition Act No. 89 of 1998 provides the legal framework for the establishment and working of the Competition Commission responsible for investigating market functioning and two courts (Competition Tribunal, Competition Appeal Court) to exercise jurisdiction over competition-related matters. In February 2023, the Competition Commission released draft regulations for identifying relevant factors for the ‘assessment of online intermediation and search platforms’ many of which employ AI technologies and the ‘publication of Commission Guidelines on best practice for leading platforms to remain in compliance with the Competition Act’.

### Government Actions examples:

In 2021, the Competition Commission launched its online intermediation platforms market inquiry focusing on digital platforms in the areas of e-Commerce marketplaces, online classifieds, software application stores, travel and accommodation aggregators, and food delivery services platforms. In the provisional report there is notice about how algorithms influence pricing and listening of products. In addition, the Commission also draws attention in the provisional report to the situation of historically disadvantaged people (HDP), specifically in that ‘digital markets are the fastest growing segment of the economy, and there is a real risk that a failure to ensure greater participation by HDPs will result in growing inequality in future’ and states that ‘it is therefore imperative that remedial action is taken now to address the funding gaps that exist for HDPs’. More recently, in March 2023, the Commission announced an inquiry into the impact of Generative AI platforms like ChatGPT on media and publishers in the country that could potentially impede, distort, or restrict competition for the media sector in South Africa.

### Non-state Actors examples:

Bruegel is an independent research institute based in Europe that has released publications, podcasts and blogs about the impact of AI systems on competitions law. In May 2023, an affiliate fellow at Bruegel published an article entitled ‘The age of competition in generative artificial intelligence has begun’, highlighting the complexities of Generative AI on the work of competitions authorities around the world and called for the ‘responsible development [of Generative AI] in a competitive environment that remains accessible to all.’
