# Data Check - Thematic area: Indigenous Data Sovereignty

## Definitions

Indigenous Data Sovereignty refers to the ‘assertion of rights and interests of Indigenous Peoples in relation to data about them, their territories, and their ways of life’. Indigenous data not only refers to information about indigenous communities, including their land, resources, lifestyles, customs, and traditions, but also includes forms of local and indigenous knowledge. UNESCO defines local and indigenous knowledge as ‘the understandings, skills and philosophies developed by societies with long histories of interaction with their natural surroundings’. For rural and indigenous communities, this also includes ‘language, systems of classification, resource use practices, social interactions, ritual and spirituality’, which informs many decision-making processes affecting daily life.
The Indigenous Protocol and Artificial Intelligence (Protocol) defines Indigenous data as any information that is from or about any Indigenous person or their community, territory or nation, including but not limited to their languages, knowledge, customs or traditions, intellectual property and ideas. The Protocol describes Indigenous data as “relational and reciprocal”, and thus needs to reflect - and be held by - the community as a collective, which is important to pass down through generations."
Closely related is the concept of Indigenous Data Governance, which refers to ‘both the stewardship and the processes necessary to implement indigenous control over indigenous data, (i.e. collection, storage, analysis, use, reuse)’. Stewardship, in this context, refers to the supervision of the ways in which indigenous data is collected, stored, analyzed, used, reused, and exchanged.

## Identifications

This indicator examines the measures countries have in place to promote Indigenous Data Sovereignty at all three levels. In particular, evidence must account for (1) frameworks to protect indigenous data sovereignty in the context of AI systems, (2) government actions to implement these frameworks or to address issues relating to indigenous data sovereignty in the context of AI , and (3) non-state actors working to advance indigenous data sovereignty in the context of AI in the country.
Frameworks may take the form of laws, regulations, policies (including by sector and/or department), and/or guidelines. Government actions may include draft laws, policies or guidelines, as well as the establishment of expert working groups to provide policy recommendations or guidance on the topic.. Non-state actors (NSAs) may include non-governmental organisations (NGOs), but also multinational corporations, private military organisations, media outlets, organised ethnic groups, academic institutions, lobby groups, labour unions or social movements working to advance indigenous data sovereignty across the country.


## Some Examples:

### Frameworks examples:

In 2018, the National Statistics Office of New Zealand (Stats NZ), published Ngā Tikanga Paihere Guidelines to: (1) inform the safe, responsible, and culturally appropriate use of microdata; (2) ensure microdata use is carefully considered; and (3) ensure microdata practices occur in good faith, by requiring conformity with cultural values of Indigenous persons when engaging with their data. (Microdata is defined as administrative data provided and held by government agencies, including census and population data which can be used to train AI systems.) The primary target of the framework is the Māori people and other under-represented sub-groups in an effort to gather deeper insights about data relating to Indigenous communities by building better relationships with communities themselves.

### Government Actions examples:

To safeguard data about Indigenous communities, Stats NZ requires those interested in accessing microdata for research projects, which may include the development and prototyping of AI systems, to submit applications to demonstrate their compliance with the Ngā Tikanga Paihere Guidelines and the Five Safes framework, which requires: safe people, safe projects, safe settings, safe data, and safe output. Approval is given by the Government Statistician or another delegated person to determine whether all requirements of the frameworks have been met.

### Non-state Actors examples:

An example of a community that has established an Indigenous Data Sovereignty Protocol is the Maori Community in New Zealand. This community “recorded and annotated 300 hours of the Te Reo Maori Language”. These recordings (data) have the potential of being appropriated for “building tools such as spell-checkers, grammar assistants, speech recognition, and speech-to text technology”. In order to protect the data from “Western data sharing and open data initiatives”, the community established the Indigenous Data Sovereignty Protocol that gives them complete control over their own data. This Protocol prevents the data mining practices and control by Western companies and gives them “autonomy” over their data, and “self-determination”. It also enables them to ensure that the community data is used in a way that benefits the community

## Search Term Guidance Helper

- Helpful alternative search terms may include ‘local communities’, ‘indigenous persons’ and ‘native peoples’ and because frameworks may not explicitly reference AI, it may be productive to search for ‘natural language processing’, ‘voice recognition software’.
